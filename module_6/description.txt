This was my first experience of parsing data, using the CatBoost library, and stacking, which I did in the data Science course from SkillFactory. 
The legend said that we have a dataset with the characteristics of used BMW cars. 
The task was to build a model for predicting the cost of such cars, based on data collected from the Internet.
