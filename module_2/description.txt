This was my first ever EDA (exploratory data analysis), performed during the data science course by SkillFactory. The legend was that we have a UNICEF dataset with the results of math exams and living conditions of students. 

We needed to find out how living conditions affect students academic performance. This was necessary in order to identify at-risk students at an early stage. After that we could build an ML model to predict exam results for each student, depending on their living conditions.

Let's follow the actions taken during the analysis:
1. We initialized necessary libraries, set visualization conditions and loaded the dataset.
2. We improved readability of the data and calculated the number of unique values for each variable. It became clear that we were dealing with a large number of categorical features (both object and int/float) and several continuous ones.
3. We checked the data for missing values and removed the missing values from the target variable. Then we checked the data for duplicates and found out that there are no duplicates. 
4. After processing the data, we built histograms for all features in the dataset. Using histograms, we evaluated distributions, identified and corrected a couple misspeled values. 
5. We defined a function for detecting outliers and applied it to numeric features. There were not many outliers, but we still widen the range to save some values.
6. After that, we created a correlation matrix, found a lot of positive and inverse correlations, identified numeric variables that correlate with the target variable, and removed some of the columns that do not correlate with it directly.
7. We created boxplots for object features and tried to guess which ones might affect the target variable. 
8. To make sure that we were right, we tested our hypotheses using the T-test. Some of our hypotheses were correct, so we removed columns, which doesn't affect the target variable.
