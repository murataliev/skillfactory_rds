This was my first experience developing a mathematical model for data prediction, which I received in the Data Science course from SkillFactory. The legend was that we have a TripAdvisor dataset with EU-based restaurants. TA has "dishonest" restaurants which artificially inflate their rating. One way to find scammers is to build a model that predicts the restaurant's rating. If the model's forecasts are vastly different from the actual result, it is possible that the restaurant is not playing fair.
