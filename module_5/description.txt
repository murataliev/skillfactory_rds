This was my first experience using a logistic regression for classification purpose, 
which I have done in the Data Science course from SkillFactory. 

The legend was that we have a dataset for credit scoring. 

The task was to build a model for predicting the probability of default of secondary clients. 

The development time was limited to 48 hours.
